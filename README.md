## About OLED

The OntoUML lightweight editor (OLED) is an environment for the development, evaluation and implementation of domain ontologies using the UFO-based ontologically well-founded modeling language OntoUML. The tool provides a simple, lightweight and integrated set of features to ontology engineers, such as syntactical verification, visual simulation, model checking, model inference, automatic semantic-anti-patterns detection and correction, validation of parthood relations and ontology patterns. The tool is mainly based on the TinyUML editor and aggregates many direct and indirect contributions for [NEMO](http://nemo.inf.ufes.br/) research group members. OLED supports models from Sparx System Enterprise Architect. The modeler can import models designed with EA into OLED and benefit from all the editor's capabilities.
